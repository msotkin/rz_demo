"As I remember, Adam, it was upon this fashion"
"bequeathed me by will but poor a thousand crowns,"
"and, as thou sayest, charged my brother, on his"
"blessing, to breed me well: and there begins my"
"sadness. My brother Jaques he keeps at school, and"
"report speaks goldenly of his profit: for my part,"
"he keeps me rustically at home, or, to speak more"
"properly, stays me here at home unkept; for call you"
"that keeping for a gentleman of my birth, that"
differs not from the stalling of an ox? His horses
"are bred better; for, besides that they are fair"
"with their feeding, they are taught their manage,"
"and to that end riders dearly hired: but I, his"
"brother, gain nothing under him but growth; for the"
which his animals on his dunghills are as much
bound to him as I. Besides this nothing that he so
"plentifully gives me, the something that nature gave"
me his countenance seems to take from me: he lets
"me feed with his hinds, bars me the place of a"
"brother, and, as much as in him lies, mines my"
"gentility with my education. This is it, Adam, that"
"grieves me; and the spirit of my father, which I"
"think is within me, begins to mutiny against this"
"servitude: I will no longer endure it, though yet I"
know no wise remedy how to avoid it.
"Yonder comes my master, your brother."
"Go apart, Adam, and thou shalt hear how he will"
shake me up.
"Now, sir! what make you here?"
Nothing: I am not taught to make any thing.
"What mar you then, sir?"
"Marry, sir, I am helping you to mar that which God"
"made, a poor unworthy brother of yours, with idleness."
"Marry, sir, be better employed, and be naught awhile."
Shall I keep your hogs and eat husks with them?
"What prodigal portion have I spent, that I should"
come to such penury?
"Know you where your are, sir?"
"O, sir, very well; here in your orchard."
"Know you before whom, sir?"
"Ay, better than him I am before knows me. I know"
"you are my eldest brother; and, in the gentle"
"condition of blood, you should so know me. The"
"courtesy of nations allows you my better, in that"
you are the first-born; but the same tradition
"takes not away my blood, were there twenty brothers"
betwixt us: I have as much of my father in me as
"you; albeit, I confess, your coming before me is"
nearer to his reverence.
"What, boy!"
"Come, come, elder brother, you are too young in this."
"Wilt thou lay hands on me, villain?"
I am no villain; I am the youngest son of Sir
"Rowland de Boys; he was my father, and he is thrice"
a villain that says such a father begot villains.
"Wert thou not my brother, I would not take this hand"
from thy throat till this other had pulled out thy
tongue for saying so: thou hast railed on thyself.
"Sweet masters, be patient: for your father's"
"remembrance, be at accord."
"Let me go, I say."
"I will not, till I please: you shall hear me. My"
father charged you in his will to give me good
"education: you have trained me like a peasant,"
obscuring and hiding from me all gentleman-like
qualities. The spirit of my father grows strong in
"me, and I will no longer endure it: therefore allow"
"me such exercises as may become a gentleman, or"
give me the poor allottery my father left me by
testament; with that I will go buy my fortunes.
"And what wilt thou do? beg, when that is spent?"
"Well, sir, get you in: I will not long be troubled"
with you; you shall have some part of your will: I
"pray you, leave me."
I will no further offend you than becomes me for my good.
"Get you with him, you old dog."
"Is 'old dog' my reward? Most true, I have lost my"
teeth in your service. God be with my old master!
he would not have spoke such a word.
Is it even so? begin you to grow upon me? I will
"physic your rankness, and yet give no thousand"
"crowns neither. Holla, Dennis!"
Calls your worship?
"Was not Charles, the duke's wrestler, here to speak with me?"
"So please you, he is here at the door and importunes"
access to you.
Call him in.
'Twill be a good way; and to-morrow the wrestling is.
Good morrow to your worship.
"Good Monsieur Charles, what's the new news at the"
new court?
"There's no news at the court, sir, but the old news:"
"that is, the old duke is banished by his younger"
brother the new duke; and three or four loving lords
"have put themselves into voluntary exile with him,"
whose lands and revenues enrich the new duke;
therefore he gives them good leave to wander.
"Can you tell if Rosalind, the duke's daughter, be"
banished with her father?
"O, no; for the duke's daughter, her cousin, so loves"
"her, being ever from their cradles bred together,"
"that she would have followed her exile, or have died"
"to stay behind her. She is at the court, and no"
less beloved of her uncle than his own daughter; and
never two ladies loved as they do.
Where will the old duke live?
"They say he is already in the forest of Arden, and"
a many merry men with him; and there they live like
the old Robin Hood of England: they say many young
"gentlemen flock to him every day, and fleet the time"
"carelessly, as they did in the golden world."
"What, you wrestle to-morrow before the new duke?"
"Marry, do I, sir; and I came to acquaint you with a"
"matter. I am given, sir, secretly to understand"
that your younger brother Orlando hath a disposition
to come in disguised against me to try a fall.
"To-morrow, sir, I wrestle for my credit; and he that"
escapes me without some broken limb shall acquit him
"well. Your brother is but young and tender; and,"
"for your love, I would be loath to foil him, as I"
"must, for my own honour, if he come in: therefore,"
"out of my love to you, I came hither to acquaint you"
"withal, that either you might stay him from his"
intendment or brook such disgrace well as he shall
"run into, in that it is a thing of his own search"
and altogether against my will.
"Charles, I thank thee for thy love to me, which"
thou shalt find I will most kindly requite. I had
myself notice of my brother's purpose herein and
have by underhand means laboured to dissuade him from
"it, but he is resolute. I'll tell thee, Charles:"
"it is the stubbornest young fellow of France, full"
"of ambition, an envious emulator of every man's"
"good parts, a secret and villanous contriver against"
me his natural brother: therefore use thy
discretion; I had as lief thou didst break his neck
as his finger. And thou wert best look to't; for if
thou dost him any slight disgrace or if he do not
"mightily grace himself on thee, he will practise"
"against thee by poison, entrap thee by some"
treacherous device and never leave thee till he
hath ta'en thy life by some indirect means or other;
"for, I assure thee, and almost with tears I speak"
"it, there is not one so young and so villanous this"
day living. I speak but brotherly of him; but
"should I anatomize him to thee as he is, I must"
blush and weep and thou must look pale and wonder.
I am heartily glad I came hither to you. If he come
"to-morrow, I'll give him his payment: if ever he go"
"alone again, I'll never wrestle for prize more: and"
so God keep your worship!
"Farewell, good Charles."
Now will I stir this gamester: I hope I shall see
"an end of him; for my soul, yet I know not why,"
"hates nothing more than he. Yet he's gentle, never"
"schooled and yet learned, full of noble device, of"
"all sorts enchantingly beloved, and indeed so much"
"in the heart of the world, and especially of my own"
"people, who best know him, that I am altogether"
misprised: but it shall not be so long; this
wrestler shall clear all: nothing remains but that
I kindle the boy thither; which now I'll go about.
"I pray thee, Rosalind, sweet my coz, be merry."
"Dear Celia, I show more mirth than I am mistress of;"
and would you yet I were merrier? Unless you could
"teach me to forget a banished father, you must not"
learn me how to remember any extraordinary pleasure.
Herein I see thou lovest me not with the full weight
"that I love thee. If my uncle, thy banished father,"
"had banished thy uncle, the duke my father, so thou"
"hadst been still with me, I could have taught my"
"love to take thy father for mine: so wouldst thou,"
if the truth of thy love to me were so righteously
tempered as mine is to thee.
"Well, I will forget the condition of my estate, to"
rejoice in yours.
"You know my father hath no child but I, nor none is"
"like to have: and, truly, when he dies, thou shalt"
"be his heir, for what he hath taken away from thy"
"father perforce, I will render thee again in"
"affection; by mine honour, I will; and when I break"
"that oath, let me turn monster: therefore, my"
"sweet Rose, my dear Rose, be merry."
"From henceforth I will, coz, and devise sports. Let"
me see; what think you of falling in love?
"Marry, I prithee, do, to make sport withal: but"
love no man in good earnest; nor no further in sport
neither than with safety of a pure blush thou mayst
in honour come off again.
"What shall be our sport, then?"
Let us sit and mock the good housewife Fortune from
"her wheel, that her gifts may henceforth be bestowed equally."
"I would we could do so, for her benefits are"
"mightily misplaced, and the bountiful blind woman"
doth most mistake in her gifts to women.
'Tis true; for those that she makes fair she scarce
"makes honest, and those that she makes honest she"
makes very ill-favouredly.
"Nay, now thou goest from Fortune's office to"
"Nature's: Fortune reigns in gifts of the world,"
not in the lineaments of Nature.
"No? when Nature hath made a fair creature, may she"
not by Fortune fall into the fire? Though Nature
"hath given us wit to flout at Fortune, hath not"
Fortune sent in this fool to cut off the argument?
"Indeed, there is Fortune too hard for Nature, when"
Fortune makes Nature's natural the cutter-off of
Nature's wit.
"Peradventure this is not Fortune's work neither, but"
Nature's; who perceiveth our natural wits too dull
to reason of such goddesses and hath sent this
natural for our whetstone; for always the dulness of
"the fool is the whetstone of the wits. How now,"
wit! whither wander you?
"Mistress, you must come away to your father."
Were you made the messenger?
"No, by mine honour, but I was bid to come for you."
"Where learned you that oath, fool?"
Of a certain knight that swore by his honour they
were good pancakes and swore by his honour the
"mustard was naught: now I'll stand to it, the"
"pancakes were naught and the mustard was good, and"
yet was not the knight forsworn.
"How prove you that, in the great heap of your"
knowledge?
"Ay, marry, now unmuzzle your wisdom."
"Stand you both forth now: stroke your chins, and"
swear by your beards that I am a knave.
"By our beards, if we had them, thou art."
"By my knavery, if I had it, then I were; but if you"
"swear by that that is not, you are not forsworn: no"
"more was this knight swearing by his honour, for he"
"never had any; or if he had, he had sworn it away"
before ever he saw those pancakes or that mustard.
"Prithee, who is't that thou meanest?"
"One that old Frederick, your father, loves."
My father's love is enough to honour him: enough!
speak no more of him; you'll be whipped for taxation
one of these days.
"The more pity, that fools may not speak wisely what"
wise men do foolishly.
"By my troth, thou sayest true; for since the little"
"wit that fools have was silenced, the little foolery"
that wise men have makes a great show. Here comes
Monsieur Le Beau.
With his mouth full of news.
"Which he will put on us, as pigeons feed their young."
Then shall we be news-crammed.
All the better; we shall be the more marketable.
"Bon jour, Monsieur Le Beau: what's the news?"
"Fair princess, you have lost much good sport."
Sport! of what colour?
"What colour, madam! how shall I answer you?"
As wit and fortune will.
Or as the Destinies decree.
Well said: that was laid on with a trowel.
"Nay, if I keep not my rank,--"
Thou losest thy old smell.
"You amaze me, ladies: I would have told you of good"
"wrestling, which you have lost the sight of."
You tell us the manner of the wrestling.
"I will tell you the beginning; and, if it please"
"your ladyships, you may see the end; for the best is"
"yet to do; and here, where you are, they are coming"
to perform it.
"Well, the beginning, that is dead and buried."
"There comes an old man and his three sons,--"
I could match this beginning with an old tale.
"Three proper young men, of excellent growth and presence."
"With bills on their necks, 'Be it known unto all men"
by these presents.'
"The eldest of the three wrestled with Charles, the"
duke's wrestler; which Charles in a moment threw him
"and broke three of his ribs, that there is little"
"hope of life in him: so he served the second, and"
"so the third. Yonder they lie; the poor old man,"
"their father, making such pitiful dole over them"
that all the beholders take his part with weeping.
Alas!
"But what is the sport, monsieur, that the ladies"
have lost?
"Why, this that I speak of."
Thus men may grow wiser every day: it is the first
time that ever I heard breaking of ribs was sport
for ladies.
"Or I, I promise thee."
But is there any else longs to see this broken music
in his sides? is there yet another dotes upon
"rib-breaking? Shall we see this wrestling, cousin?"
"You must, if you stay here; for here is the place"
"appointed for the wrestling, and they are ready to"
perform it.
"Yonder, sure, they are coming: let us now stay and see it."
"Come on: since the youth will not be entreated, his"
own peril on his forwardness.
Is yonder the man?
"Even he, madam."
"Alas, he is too young! yet he looks successfully."
"How now, daughter and cousin! are you crept hither"
to see the wrestling?
"Ay, my liege, so please you give us leave."
"You will take little delight in it, I can tell you;"
there is such odds in the man. In pity of the
"challenger's youth I would fain dissuade him, but he"
"will not be entreated. Speak to him, ladies; see if"
you can move him.
"Call him hither, good Monsieur Le Beau."
Do so: I'll not be by.
"Monsieur the challenger, the princesses call for you."
I attend them with all respect and duty.
"Young man, have you challenged Charles the wrestler?"
"No, fair princess; he is the general challenger: I"
"come but in, as others do, to try with him the"
strength of my youth.
"Young gentleman, your spirits are too bold for your"
years. You have seen cruel proof of this man's
strength: if you saw yourself with your eyes or
"knew yourself with your judgment, the fear of your"
adventure would counsel you to a more equal
"enterprise. We pray you, for your own sake, to"
embrace your own safety and give over this attempt.
"Do, young sir; your reputation shall not therefore"
be misprised: we will make it our suit to the duke
that the wrestling might not go forward.
"I beseech you, punish me not with your hard"
"thoughts; wherein I confess me much guilty, to deny"
so fair and excellent ladies any thing. But let
your fair eyes and gentle wishes go with me to my
"trial: wherein if I be foiled, there is but one"
"shamed that was never gracious; if killed, but one"
dead that was willing to be so: I shall do my
"friends no wrong, for I have none to lament me, the"
"world no injury, for in it I have nothing; only in"
"the world I fill up a place, which may be better"
supplied when I have made it empty.
"The little strength that I have, I would it were with you."
"And mine, to eke out hers."
Fare you well: pray heaven I be deceived in you!
Your heart's desires be with you!
"Come, where is this young gallant that is so"
desirous to lie with his mother earth?
"Ready, sir; but his will hath in it a more modest working."
You shall try but one fall.
"No, I warrant your grace, you shall not entreat him"
"to a second, that have so mightily persuaded him"
from a first.
"An you mean to mock me after, you should not have"
mocked me before: but come your ways.
"Now Hercules be thy speed, young man!"
"I would I were invisible, to catch the strong"
fellow by the leg.
O excellent young man!
"If I had a thunderbolt in mine eye, I can tell who"
should down.
"No more, no more."
"Yes, I beseech your grace: I am not yet well breathed."
"How dost thou, Charles?"
"He cannot speak, my lord."
"Bear him away. What is thy name, young man?"
"Orlando, my liege; the youngest son of Sir Rowland de Boys."
I would thou hadst been son to some man else:
"The world esteem'd thy father honourable,"
But I did find him still mine enemy:
"Thou shouldst have better pleased me with this deed,"
Hadst thou descended from another house.
But fare thee well; thou art a gallant youth:
I would thou hadst told me of another father.
"Were I my father, coz, would I do this?"
"I am more proud to be Sir Rowland's son,"
"His youngest son; and would not change that calling,"
To be adopted heir to Frederick.
"My father loved Sir Rowland as his soul,"
And all the world was of my father's mind:
"Had I before known this young man his son,"
"I should have given him tears unto entreaties,"
Ere he should thus have ventured.
"Gentle cousin,"
Let us go thank him and encourage him:
My father's rough and envious disposition
"Sticks me at heart. Sir, you have well deserved:"
If you do keep your promises in love
"But justly, as you have exceeded all promise,"
Your mistress shall be happy.
"Gentleman,"
"Wear this for me, one out of suits with fortune,"
"That could give more, but that her hand lacks means."
"Shall we go, coz?"
"Ay. Fare you well, fair gentleman."
"Can I not say, I thank you? My better parts"
"Are all thrown down, and that which here stands up"
"Is but a quintain, a mere lifeless block."
He calls us back: my pride fell with my fortunes;
"I'll ask him what he would. Did you call, sir?"
"Sir, you have wrestled well and overthrown"
More than your enemies.
"Will you go, coz?"
Have with you. Fare you well.
What passion hangs these weights upon my tongue?
"I cannot speak to her, yet she urged conference."
"O poor Orlando, thou art overthrown!"
Or Charles or something weaker masters thee.
"Good sir, I do in friendship counsel you"
To leave this place. Albeit you have deserved
"High commendation, true applause and love,"
Yet such is now the duke's condition
That he misconstrues all that you have done.
"The duke is humorous; what he is indeed,"
More suits you to conceive than I to speak of.
"I thank you, sir: and, pray you, tell me this:"
Which of the two was daughter of the duke
That here was at the wrestling?
"Neither his daughter, if we judge by manners;"
But yet indeed the lesser is his daughter
"The other is daughter to the banish'd duke,"
"And here detain'd by her usurping uncle,"
To keep his daughter company; whose loves
Are dearer than the natural bond of sisters.
But I can tell you that of late this duke
"Hath ta'en displeasure 'gainst his gentle niece,"
Grounded upon no other argument
But that the people praise her for her virtues
And pity her for her good father's sake;
"And, on my life, his malice 'gainst the lady"
"Will suddenly break forth. Sir, fare you well:"
"Hereafter, in a better world than this,"
I shall desire more love and knowledge of you.
I rest much bounden to you: fare you well.
Thus must I from the smoke into the smother;
From tyrant duke unto a tyrant brother:
But heavenly Rosalind!
"Why, cousin! why, Rosalind! Cupid have mercy! not a word?"
Not one to throw at a dog.
"No, thy words are too precious to be cast away upon"
"curs; throw some of them at me; come, lame me with reasons."
Then there were two cousins laid up; when the one
should be lamed with reasons and the other mad
without any.
But is all this for your father?
"No, some of it is for my child's father. O, how"
full of briers is this working-day world!
"They are but burs, cousin, thrown upon thee in"
holiday foolery: if we walk not in the trodden
paths our very petticoats will catch them.
I could shake them off my coat: these burs are in my heart.
Hem them away.
"I would try, if I could cry 'hem' and have him."
"Come, come, wrestle with thy affections."
"O, they take the part of a better wrestler than myself!"
"O, a good wish upon you! you will try in time, in"
"despite of a fall. But, turning these jests out of"
"service, let us talk in good earnest: is it"
"possible, on such a sudden, you should fall into so"
strong a liking with old Sir Rowland's youngest son?
The duke my father loved his father dearly.
Doth it therefore ensue that you should love his son
"dearly? By this kind of chase, I should hate him,"
for my father hated his father dearly; yet I hate
not Orlando.
"No, faith, hate him not, for my sake."
Why should I not? doth he not deserve well?
"Let me love him for that, and do you love him"
"because I do. Look, here comes the duke."
With his eyes full of anger.
"Mistress, dispatch you with your safest haste"
And get you from our court.
"Me, uncle?"
"You, cousin"
"So near our public court as twenty miles,"
Thou diest for it.
"I do beseech your grace,"
Let me the knowledge of my fault bear with me:
If with myself I hold intelligence
"Or have acquaintance with mine own desires,"
"If that I do not dream or be not frantic,--"
"As I do trust I am not--then, dear uncle,"
Never so much as in a thought unborn
Did I offend your highness.
Thus do all traitors:
"If their purgation did consist in words,"
They are as innocent as grace itself:
Let it suffice thee that I trust thee not.
Yet your mistrust cannot make me a traitor:
Tell me whereon the likelihood depends.
Thou art thy father's daughter; there's enough.
So was I when your highness took his dukedom;
So was I when your highness banish'd him:
"Treason is not inherited, my lord;"
"Or, if we did derive it from our friends,"
What's that to me? my father was no traitor:
"Then, good my liege, mistake me not so much"
To think my poverty is treacherous.
"Dear sovereign, hear me speak."
"Ay, Celia; we stay'd her for your sake,"
Else had she with her father ranged along.
I did not then entreat to have her stay;
It was your pleasure and your own remorse:
I was too young that time to value her;
"But now I know her: if she be a traitor,"
"Why so am I; we still have slept together,"
"Rose at an instant, learn'd, play'd, eat together,"
"And wheresoever we went, like Juno's swans,"
Still we went coupled and inseparable.
"She is too subtle for thee; and her smoothness,"
Her very silence and her patience
"Speak to the people, and they pity her."
Thou art a fool: she robs thee of thy name;
And thou wilt show more bright and seem more virtuous
When she is gone. Then open not thy lips:
Firm and irrevocable is my doom
Which I have pass'd upon her; she is banish'd.
"Pronounce that sentence then on me, my liege:"
I cannot live out of her company.
"You are a fool. You, niece, provide yourself:"
"If you outstay the time, upon mine honour,"
"And in the greatness of my word, you die."
"O my poor Rosalind, whither wilt thou go?"
Wilt thou change fathers? I will give thee mine.
"I charge thee, be not thou more grieved than I am."
I have more cause.
"Thou hast not, cousin;"
"Prithee be cheerful: know'st thou not, the duke"
"Hath banish'd me, his daughter?"
That he hath not.
"No, hath not? Rosalind lacks then the love"
Which teacheth thee that thou and I am one:
"Shall we be sunder'd? shall we part, sweet girl?"
No: let my father seek another heir.
"Therefore devise with me how we may fly,"
Whither to go and what to bear with us;
"And do not seek to take your change upon you,"
To bear your griefs yourself and leave me out;
"For, by this heaven, now at our sorrows pale,"
"Say what thou canst, I'll go along with thee."
"Why, whither shall we go?"
To seek my uncle in the forest of Arden.
"Alas, what danger will it be to us,"
"Maids as we are, to travel forth so far!"
Beauty provoketh thieves sooner than gold.
I'll put myself in poor and mean attire
And with a kind of umber smirch my face;
The like do you: so shall we pass along
And never stir assailants.
"Were it not better,"
"Because that I am more than common tall,"
That I did suit me all points like a man?
"A gallant curtle-axe upon my thigh,"
A boar-spear in my hand; and--in my heart
Lie there what hidden woman's fear there will--
"We'll have a swashing and a martial outside,"
As many other mannish cowards have
That do outface it with their semblances.
What shall I call thee when thou art a man?
I'll have no worse a name than Jove's own page;
And therefore look you call me Ganymede.
But what will you be call'd?
Something that hath a reference to my state
"No longer Celia, but Aliena."
"But, cousin, what if we assay'd to steal"
The clownish fool out of your father's court?
Would he not be a comfort to our travel?
He'll go along o'er the wide world with me;
"Leave me alone to woo him. Let's away,"
"And get our jewels and our wealth together,"
Devise the fittest time and safest way
To hide us from pursuit that will be made
After my flight. Now go we in content
To liberty and not to banishment.
"Now, my co-mates and brothers in exile,"
Hath not old custom made this life more sweet
Than that of painted pomp? Are not these woods
More free from peril than the envious court?
"Here feel we but the penalty of Adam,"
"The seasons' difference, as the icy fang"
"And churlish chiding of the winter's wind,"
"Which, when it bites and blows upon my body,"
"Even till I shrink with cold, I smile and say"
'This is no flattery: these are counsellors
That feelingly persuade me what I am.'
"Sweet are the uses of adversity,"
"Which, like the toad, ugly and venomous,"
Wears yet a precious jewel in his head;
And this our life exempt from public haunt
"Finds tongues in trees, books in the running brooks,"
Sermons in stones and good in every thing.
I would not change it.
"Happy is your grace,"
That can translate the stubbornness of fortune
Into so quiet and so sweet a style.
"Come, shall we go and kill us venison?"
"And yet it irks me the poor dappled fools,"
"Being native burghers of this desert city,"
Should in their own confines with forked heads
Have their round haunches gored.
"Indeed, my lord,"
"The melancholy Jaques grieves at that,"
"And, in that kind, swears you do more usurp"
Than doth your brother that hath banish'd you.
To-day my Lord of Amiens and myself
Did steal behind him as he lay along
Under an oak whose antique root peeps out
Upon the brook that brawls along this wood:
"To the which place a poor sequester'd stag,"
"That from the hunter's aim had ta'en a hurt,"
"Did come to languish, and indeed, my lord,"
The wretched animal heaved forth such groans
That their discharge did stretch his leathern coat
"Almost to bursting, and the big round tears"
Coursed one another down his innocent nose
In piteous chase; and thus the hairy fool
"Much marked of the melancholy Jaques,"
"Stood on the extremest verge of the swift brook,"
Augmenting it with tears.
But what said Jaques?
Did he not moralize this spectacle?
"O, yes, into a thousand similes."
"First, for his weeping into the needless stream;"
"'Poor deer,' quoth he, 'thou makest a testament"
"As worldlings do, giving thy sum of more"
"To that which had too much:' then, being there alone,"
"Left and abandon'd of his velvet friends,"
''Tis right:' quoth he; 'thus misery doth part
"The flux of company:' anon a careless herd,"
"Full of the pasture, jumps along by him"
"And never stays to greet him; 'Ay' quoth Jaques,"
"'Sweep on, you fat and greasy citizens;"
'Tis just the fashion: wherefore do you look
Upon that poor and broken bankrupt there?'
Thus most invectively he pierceth through
"The body of the country, city, court,"
"Yea, and of this our life, swearing that we"
"Are mere usurpers, tyrants and what's worse,"
To fright the animals and to kill them up
In their assign'd and native dwelling-place.
And did you leave him in this contemplation?
"We did, my lord, weeping and commenting"
Upon the sobbing deer.
Show me the place:
"I love to cope him in these sullen fits,"
For then he's full of matter.
I'll bring you to him straight.
Can it be possible that no man saw them?
It cannot be: some villains of my court
Are of consent and sufferance in this.
I cannot hear of any that did see her.
"The ladies, her attendants of her chamber,"
"Saw her abed, and in the morning early"
They found the bed untreasured of their mistress.
"My lord, the roynish clown, at whom so oft"
"Your grace was wont to laugh, is also missing."
"Hisperia, the princess' gentlewoman,"
Confesses that she secretly o'erheard
Your daughter and her cousin much commend
The parts and graces of the wrestler
That did but lately foil the sinewy Charles;
"And she believes, wherever they are gone,"
That youth is surely in their company.
Send to his brother; fetch that gallant hither;
"If he be absent, bring his brother to me;"
"I'll make him find him: do this suddenly,"
And let not search and inquisition quail
To bring again these foolish runaways.
Who's there?
"What, my young master? O, my gentle master!"
O my sweet master! O you memory
"Of old Sir Rowland! why, what make you here?"
Why are you virtuous? why do people love you?
"And wherefore are you gentle, strong and valiant?"
Why would you be so fond to overcome
The bonny priser of the humorous duke?
Your praise is come too swiftly home before you.
"Know you not, master, to some kind of men"
Their graces serve them but as enemies?
"No more do yours: your virtues, gentle master,"
Are sanctified and holy traitors to you.
"O, what a world is this, when what is comely"
Envenoms him that bears it!
"Why, what's the matter?"
O unhappy youth!
Come not within these doors; within this roof
The enemy of all your graces lives:
"Your brother--no, no brother; yet the son--"
"Yet not the son, I will not call him son"
Of him I was about to call his father--
"Hath heard your praises, and this night he means"
To burn the lodging where you use to lie
"And you within it: if he fail of that,"
He will have other means to cut you off.
I overheard him and his practises.
This is no place; this house is but a butchery:
"Abhor it, fear it, do not enter it."
"Why, whither, Adam, wouldst thou have me go?"
"No matter whither, so you come not here."
"What, wouldst thou have me go and beg my food?"
Or with a base and boisterous sword enforce
A thievish living on the common road?
"This I must do, or know not what to do:"
"Yet this I will not do, do how I can;"
I rather will subject me to the malice
Of a diverted blood and bloody brother.
"But do not so. I have five hundred crowns,"
"The thrifty hire I saved under your father,"
Which I did store to be my foster-nurse
When service should in my old limbs lie lame
"Take that, and He that doth the ravens feed,"
"Yea, providently caters for the sparrow,"
Be comfort to my age! Here is the gold;
And all this I give you. Let me be your servant:
"Though I look old, yet I am strong and lusty;"
For in my youth I never did apply
"Hot and rebellious liquors in my blood,"
Nor did not with unbashful forehead woo
The means of weakness and debility;
"Therefore my age is as a lusty winter,"
"Frosty, but kindly: let me go with you;"
I'll do the service of a younger man
In all your business and necessities.
"O good old man, how well in thee appears"
"The constant service of the antique world,"
"When service sweat for duty, not for meed!"
"Thou art not for the fashion of these times,"
"Where none will sweat but for promotion,"
"And having that, do choke their service up"
Even with the having: it is not so with thee.
"But, poor old man, thou prunest a rotten tree,"
That cannot so much as a blossom yield
In lieu of all thy pains and husbandry
"But come thy ways; well go along together,"
"And ere we have thy youthful wages spent,"
We'll light upon some settled low content.
"Master, go on, and I will follow thee,"
"To the last gasp, with truth and loyalty."
From seventeen years till now almost fourscore
"Here lived I, but now live here no more."
At seventeen years many their fortunes seek;
But at fourscore it is too late a week:
Yet fortune cannot recompense me better
Than to die well and not my master's debtor.
"O Jupiter, how weary are my spirits!"
"I care not for my spirits, if my legs were not weary."
I could find in my heart to disgrace my man's
apparel and to cry like a woman; but I must comfort
"the weaker vessel, as doublet and hose ought to show"
"itself courageous to petticoat: therefore courage,"
good Aliena!
"I pray you, bear with me; I cannot go no further."
"For my part, I had rather bear with you than bear"
"you; yet I should bear no cross if I did bear you,"
for I think you have no money in your purse.
"Well, this is the forest of Arden."
"Ay, now am I in Arden; the more fool I; when I was"
"at home, I was in a better place: but travellers"
must be content.
"Ay, be so, good Touchstone."
"Look you, who comes here; a young man and an old in"
solemn talk.
That is the way to make her scorn you still.
"O Corin, that thou knew'st how I do love her!"
I partly guess; for I have loved ere now.
"No, Corin, being old, thou canst not guess,"
Though in thy youth thou wast as true a lover
As ever sigh'd upon a midnight pillow:
But if thy love were ever like to mine--
As sure I think did never man love so--
How many actions most ridiculous
Hast thou been drawn to by thy fantasy?
Into a thousand that I have forgotten.
"O, thou didst then ne'er love so heartily!"
If thou remember'st not the slightest folly
"That ever love did make thee run into,"
Thou hast not loved:
"Or if thou hast not sat as I do now,"
"Wearying thy hearer in thy mistress' praise,"
Thou hast not loved:
Or if thou hast not broke from company
"Abruptly, as my passion now makes me,"
Thou hast not loved.
"O Phebe, Phebe, Phebe!"
"Alas, poor shepherd! searching of thy wound,"
I have by hard adventure found mine own.
"And I mine. I remember, when I was in love I broke"
my sword upon a stone and bid him take that for
coming a-night to Jane Smile; and I remember the
kissing of her batlet and the cow's dugs that her
pretty chopt hands had milked; and I remember the
"wooing of a peascod instead of her, from whom I took"
"two cods and, giving her them again, said with"
weeping tears 'Wear these for my sake.' We that are
true lovers run into strange capers; but as all is
"mortal in nature, so is all nature in love mortal in folly."
Thou speakest wiser than thou art ware of.
"Nay, I shall ne'er be ware of mine own wit till I"
break my shins against it.
"Jove, Jove! this shepherd's passion"
Is much upon my fashion.
And mine; but it grows something stale with me.
"I pray you, one of you question yond man"
If he for gold will give us any food:
I faint almost to death.
"Holla, you clown!"
"Peace, fool: he's not thy kinsman."
Who calls?
"Your betters, sir."
Else are they very wretched.
"Peace, I say. Good even to you, friend."
"And to you, gentle sir, and to you all."
"I prithee, shepherd, if that love or gold"
"Can in this desert place buy entertainment,"
Bring us where we may rest ourselves and feed:
Here's a young maid with travel much oppress'd
And faints for succor.
"Fair sir, I pity her"
"And wish, for her sake more than for mine own,"
My fortunes were more able to relieve her;
But I am shepherd to another man
And do not shear the fleeces that I graze:
My master is of churlish disposition
And little recks to find the way to heaven
By doing deeds of hospitality:
"Besides, his cote, his flocks and bounds of feed"
"Are now on sale, and at our sheepcote now,"
"By reason of his absence, there is nothing"
"That you will feed on; but what is, come see."
And in my voice most welcome shall you be.
What is he that shall buy his flock and pasture?
"That young swain that you saw here but erewhile,"
That little cares for buying any thing.
"I pray thee, if it stand with honesty,"
"Buy thou the cottage, pasture and the flock,"
And thou shalt have to pay for it of us.
And we will mend thy wages. I like this place.
And willingly could waste my time in it.
Assuredly the thing is to be sold:
Go with me: if you like upon report
"The soil, the profit and this kind of life,"
I will your very faithful feeder be
And buy it with your gold right suddenly.
Under the greenwood tree
"Who loves to lie with me,"
And turn his merry note
"Unto the sweet bird's throat,"
"Come hither, come hither, come hither:"
Here shall he see No enemy
But winter and rough weather.
"More, more, I prithee, more."
"It will make you melancholy, Monsieur Jaques."
"I thank it. More, I prithee, more. I can suck"
"melancholy out of a song, as a weasel sucks eggs."
"More, I prithee, more."
My voice is ragged: I know I cannot please you.
I do not desire you to please me; I do desire you to
"sing. Come, more; another stanzo: call you 'em stanzos?"
"What you will, Monsieur Jaques."
"Nay, I care not for their names; they owe me"
nothing. Will you sing?
More at your request than to please myself.
"Well then, if ever I thank any man, I'll thank you;"
but that they call compliment is like the encounter
"of two dog-apes, and when a man thanks me heartily,"
methinks I have given him a penny and he renders me
"the beggarly thanks. Come, sing; and you that will"
"not, hold your tongues."
"Well, I'll end the song. Sirs, cover the while; the"
duke will drink under this tree. He hath been all
this day to look you.
And I have been all this day to avoid him. He is
"matters as he, but I give heaven thanks and make no"
"boast of them. Come, warble, come."
Who doth ambition shun
"And loves to live i' the sun,"
Seeking the food he eats
"And pleased with what he gets,"
"Come hither, come hither, come hither:"
Here shall he see No enemy
But winter and rough weather.
I'll give you a verse to this note that I made
yesterday in despite of my invention.
And I'll sing it.
Thus it goes:--
If it do come to pass
"That any man turn ass,"
"Leaving his wealth and ease,"
"A stubborn will to please,"
"Ducdame, ducdame, ducdame:"
Here shall he see
"Gross fools as he,"
An if he will come to me.
What's that 'ducdame'?
"'Tis a Greek invocation, to call fools into a"
"circle. I'll go sleep, if I can; if I cannot, I'll"
rail against all the first-born of Egypt.
And I'll go seek the duke: his banquet is prepared.
"Dear master, I can go no further. O, I die for food!"
"Here lie I down, and measure out my grave. Farewell,"
kind master.
"Why, how now, Adam! no greater heart in thee? Live"
a little; comfort a little; cheer thyself a little.
"If this uncouth forest yield any thing savage, I"
will either be food for it or bring it for food to
thee. Thy conceit is nearer death than thy powers.
For my sake be comfortable; hold death awhile at
the arm's end: I will here be with thee presently;
"and if I bring thee not something to eat, I will"
give thee leave to die: but if thou diest before I
"come, thou art a mocker of my labour. Well said!"
"thou lookest cheerly, and I'll be with thee quickly."
"Yet thou liest in the bleak air: come, I will bear"
thee to some shelter; and thou shalt not die for
"lack of a dinner, if there live any thing in this"
"desert. Cheerly, good Adam!"
I think he be transform'd into a beast;
For I can no where find him like a man.
"My lord, he is but even now gone hence:"
"Here was he merry, hearing of a song."
"If he, compact of jars, grow musical,"
We shall have shortly discord in the spheres.
"Go, seek him: tell him I would speak with him."
He saves my labour by his own approach.
"Why, how now, monsieur! what a life is this,"
That your poor friends must woo your company?
"What, you look merrily!"
"A fool, a fool! I met a fool i' the forest,"
A motley fool; a miserable world!
"As I do live by food, I met a fool"
"Who laid him down and bask'd him in the sun,"
"And rail'd on Lady Fortune in good terms,"
In good set terms and yet a motley fool.
"'Good morrow, fool,' quoth I. 'No, sir,' quoth he,"
'Call me not fool till heaven hath sent me fortune:'
"And then he drew a dial from his poke,"
"And, looking on it with lack-lustre eye,"
"Says very wisely, 'It is ten o'clock:"
"Thus we may see,' quoth he, 'how the world wags:"
"'Tis but an hour ago since it was nine,"
And after one hour more 'twill be eleven;
"And so, from hour to hour, we ripe and ripe,"
"And then, from hour to hour, we rot and rot;"
And thereby hangs a tale.' When I did hear
"The motley fool thus moral on the time,"
"My lungs began to crow like chanticleer,"
"That fools should be so deep-contemplative,"
And I did laugh sans intermission
An hour by his dial. O noble fool!
A worthy fool! Motley's the only wear.
What fool is this?
"O worthy fool! One that hath been a courtier,"
"And says, if ladies be but young and fair,"
"They have the gift to know it: and in his brain,"
Which is as dry as the remainder biscuit
"After a voyage, he hath strange places cramm'd"
"With observation, the which he vents"
In mangled forms. O that I were a fool!
I am ambitious for a motley coat.
Thou shalt have one.
It is my only suit;
Provided that you weed your better judgments
Of all opinion that grows rank in them
That I am wise. I must have liberty
"Withal, as large a charter as the wind,"
To blow on whom I please; for so fools have;
"And they that are most galled with my folly,"
"They most must laugh. And why, sir, must they so?"
The 'why' is plain as way to parish church:
He that a fool doth very wisely hit
"Doth very foolishly, although he smart,"
"Not to seem senseless of the bob: if not,"
The wise man's folly is anatomized
Even by the squandering glances of the fool.
Invest me in my motley; give me leave
"To speak my mind, and I will through and through"
"Cleanse the foul body of the infected world,"
If they will patiently receive my medicine.
Fie on thee! I can tell what thou wouldst do.
"What, for a counter, would I do but good?"
"Most mischievous foul sin, in chiding sin:"
"For thou thyself hast been a libertine,"
As sensual as the brutish sting itself;
"And all the embossed sores and headed evils,"
Wouldst thou disgorge into the general world.
"Why, who cries out on pride,"
That can therein tax any private party?
"Doth it not flow as hugely as the sea,"
Till that the weary very means do ebb?
"What woman in the city do I name,"
When that I say the city-woman bears
The cost of princes on unworthy shoulders?
"Who can come in and say that I mean her,"
When such a one as she such is her neighbour?
Or what is he of basest function
"That says his bravery is not of my cost,"
"Thinking that I mean him, but therein suits"
His folly to the mettle of my speech?
There then; how then? what then? Let me see wherein
"My tongue hath wrong'd him: if it do him right,"
"Then he hath wrong'd himself; if he be free,"
"Why then my taxing like a wild-goose flies,"
Unclaim'd of any man. But who comes here?
"Forbear, and eat no more."
"Why, I have eat none yet."
"Nor shalt not, till necessity be served."
Of what kind should this cock come of?
"Art thou thus bolden'd, man, by thy distress,"
"Or else a rude despiser of good manners,"
That in civility thou seem'st so empty?
You touch'd my vein at first: the thorny point
Of bare distress hath ta'en from me the show
Of smooth civility: yet am I inland bred
"And know some nurture. But forbear, I say:"
He dies that touches any of this fruit
Till I and my affairs are answered.
"An you will not be answered with reason, I must die."
What would you have? Your gentleness shall force
More than your force move us to gentleness.
I almost die for food; and let me have it.
"Sit down and feed, and welcome to our table."
"Speak you so gently? Pardon me, I pray you:"
I thought that all things had been savage here;
And therefore put I on the countenance
Of stern commandment. But whate'er you are
"That in this desert inaccessible,"
"Under the shade of melancholy boughs,"
Lose and neglect the creeping hours of time
"If ever you have look'd on better days,"
"If ever been where bells have knoll'd to church,"
"If ever sat at any good man's feast,"
If ever from your eyelids wiped a tear
"And know what 'tis to pity and be pitied,"
Let gentleness my strong enforcement be:
"In the which hope I blush, and hide my sword."
"True is it that we have seen better days,"
And have with holy bell been knoll'd to church
And sat at good men's feasts and wiped our eyes
Of drops that sacred pity hath engender'd:
And therefore sit you down in gentleness
And take upon command what help we have
That to your wanting may be minister'd.
"Then but forbear your food a little while,"
"Whiles, like a doe, I go to find my fawn"
"And give it food. There is an old poor man,"
Who after me hath many a weary step
"Limp'd in pure love: till he be first sufficed,"
"Oppress'd with two weak evils, age and hunger,"
I will not touch a bit.
"Go find him out,"
And we will nothing waste till you return.
I thank ye; and be blest for your good comfort!
Thou seest we are not all alone unhappy:
This wide and universal theatre
Presents more woeful pageants than the scene
Wherein we play in.
"All the world's a stage,"
And all the men and women merely players:
They have their exits and their entrances;
"And one man in his time plays many parts,"
"His acts being seven ages. At first the infant,"
Mewling and puking in the nurse's arms.
"And then the whining school-boy, with his satchel"
"And shining morning face, creeping like snail"
"Unwillingly to school. And then the lover,"
"Sighing like furnace, with a woeful ballad"
"Made to his mistress' eyebrow. Then a soldier,"
"Full of strange oaths and bearded like the pard,"
"Jealous in honour, sudden and quick in quarrel,"
Seeking the bubble reputation
"Even in the cannon's mouth. And then the justice,"
"In fair round belly with good capon lined,"
"With eyes severe and beard of formal cut,"
Full of wise saws and modern instances;
And so he plays his part. The sixth age shifts
"Into the lean and slipper'd pantaloon,"
"With spectacles on nose and pouch on side,"
"His youthful hose, well saved, a world too wide"
"For his shrunk shank; and his big manly voice,"
"Turning again toward childish treble, pipes"
"And whistles in his sound. Last scene of all,"
"That ends this strange eventful history,"
"Is second childishness and mere oblivion,"
"Sans teeth, sans eyes, sans taste, sans everything."
"Welcome. Set down your venerable burthen,"
And let him feed.
I thank you most for him.
So had you need:
I scarce can speak to thank you for myself.
Welcome; fall to: I will not trouble you
"As yet, to question you about your fortunes."
"Give us some music; and, good cousin, sing."
"Blow, blow, thou winter wind."
Thou art not so unkind
As man's ingratitude;
"Thy tooth is not so keen,"
"Because thou art not seen,"
Although thy breath be rude.
"Heigh-ho! sing, heigh-ho! unto the green holly:"
"Most friendship is feigning, most loving mere folly:"
"Then, heigh-ho, the holly!"
This life is most jolly.
"Freeze, freeze, thou bitter sky,"
That dost not bite so nigh
As benefits forgot:
"Though thou the waters warp,"
Thy sting is not so sharp
As friend remember'd not.
"Heigh-ho! sing, &c."
"If that you were the good Sir Rowland's son,"
"As you have whisper'd faithfully you were,"
And as mine eye doth his effigies witness
"Most truly limn'd and living in your face,"
Be truly welcome hither: I am the duke
"That loved your father: the residue of your fortune,"
"Go to my cave and tell me. Good old man,"
Thou art right welcome as thy master is.
"Support him by the arm. Give me your hand,"
And let me all your fortunes understand.
"Not see him since? Sir, sir, that cannot be:"
"But were I not the better part made mercy,"
I should not seek an absent argument
"Of my revenge, thou present. But look to it:"
"Find out thy brother, wheresoe'er he is;"
Seek him with candle; bring him dead or living
"Within this twelvemonth, or turn thou no more"
To seek a living in our territory.
Thy lands and all things that thou dost call thine
"Worth seizure do we seize into our hands,"
Till thou canst quit thee by thy brothers mouth
Of what we think against thee.
O that your highness knew my heart in this!
I never loved my brother in my life.
"More villain thou. Well, push him out of doors;"
And let my officers of such a nature
Make an extent upon his house and lands:
Do this expediently and turn him going.
"Hang there, my verse, in witness of my love:"
"And thou, thrice-crowned queen of night, survey"
"With thy chaste eye, from thy pale sphere above,"
Thy huntress' name that my full life doth sway.
O Rosalind! these trees shall be my books
And in their barks my thoughts I'll character;
That every eye which in this forest looks
Shall see thy virtue witness'd every where.
"Run, run, Orlando; carve on every tree"
"The fair, the chaste and unexpressive she."
"And how like you this shepherd's life, Master Touchstone?"
"Truly, shepherd, in respect of itself, it is a good"
"life, but in respect that it is a shepherd's life,"
"it is naught. In respect that it is solitary, I"
like it very well; but in respect that it is
"private, it is a very vile life. Now, in respect it"
"is in the fields, it pleaseth me well; but in"
"respect it is not in the court, it is tedious. As"
"is it a spare life, look you, it fits my humour well;"
"but as there is no more plenty in it, it goes much"
"against my stomach. Hast any philosophy in thee, shepherd?"
No more but that I know the more one sickens the
"worse at ease he is; and that he that wants money,"
means and content is without three good friends;
that the property of rain is to wet and fire to
"burn; that good pasture makes fat sheep, and that a"
great cause of the night is lack of the sun; that
he that hath learned no wit by nature nor art may
complain of good breeding or comes of a very dull kindred.
Such a one is a natural philosopher. Wast ever in
"court, shepherd?"
"No, truly."
Then thou art damned.
"Nay, I hope."
"Truly, thou art damned like an ill-roasted egg, all"
on one side.
For not being at court? Your reason.
"Why, if thou never wast at court, thou never sawest"
"good manners; if thou never sawest good manners,"
then thy manners must be wicked; and wickedness is
"sin, and sin is damnation. Thou art in a parlous"
"state, shepherd."
"Not a whit, Touchstone: those that are good manners"
at the court are as ridiculous in the country as the
behavior of the country is most mockable at the
"court. You told me you salute not at the court, but"
you kiss your hands: that courtesy would be
"uncleanly, if courtiers were shepherds."
"Instance, briefly; come, instance."
"Why, we are still handling our ewes, and their"
"fells, you know, are greasy."
"Why, do not your courtier's hands sweat? and is not"
the grease of a mutton as wholesome as the sweat of
"a man? Shallow, shallow. A better instance, I say; come."
"Besides, our hands are hard."
Your lips will feel them the sooner. Shallow again.
"A more sounder instance, come."
And they are often tarred over with the surgery of
our sheep: and would you have us kiss tar? The
courtier's hands are perfumed with civet.
"Most shallow man! thou worms-meat, in respect of a"
"good piece of flesh indeed! Learn of the wise, and"
"perpend: civet is of a baser birth than tar, the"
"very uncleanly flux of a cat. Mend the instance, shepherd."
You have too courtly a wit for me: I'll rest.
"Wilt thou rest damned? God help thee, shallow man!"
God make incision in thee! thou art raw.
"Sir, I am a true labourer: I earn that I eat, get"
"that I wear, owe no man hate, envy no man's"
"happiness, glad of other men's good, content with my"
"harm, and the greatest of my pride is to see my ewes"
graze and my lambs suck.
"That is another simple sin in you, to bring the ewes"
and the rams together and to offer to get your
"bell-wether, and to betray a she-lamb of a"
"twelvemonth to a crooked-pated, old, cuckoldly ram,"
out of all reasonable match. If thou beest not
"damned for this, the devil himself will have no"
shepherds; I cannot see else how thou shouldst
'scape.
"Here comes young Master Ganymede, my new mistress's brother."
"From the east to western Ind,"
No jewel is like Rosalind.
"Her worth, being mounted on the wind,"
Through all the world bears Rosalind.
All the pictures fairest lined
Are but black to Rosalind.
Let no fair be kept in mind
But the fair of Rosalind.
"I'll rhyme you so eight years together, dinners and"
suppers and sleeping-hours excepted: it is the
right butter-women's rank to market.
"Out, fool!"
For a taste:
"If a hart do lack a hind,"
Let him seek out Rosalind.
"If the cat will after kind,"
So be sure will Rosalind.
"Winter garments must be lined,"
So must slender Rosalind.
They that reap must sheaf and bind;
Then to cart with Rosalind.
"Sweetest nut hath sourest rind,"
Such a nut is Rosalind.
He that sweetest rose will find
Must find love's prick and Rosalind.
This is the very false gallop of verses: why do you
infect yourself with them?
"Peace, you dull fool! I found them on a tree."
"Truly, the tree yields bad fruit."
"I'll graff it with you, and then I shall graff it"
with a medlar: then it will be the earliest fruit
i' the country; for you'll be rotten ere you be half
"ripe, and that's the right virtue of the medlar."
"You have said; but whether wisely or no, let the"
forest judge.
"Peace! Here comes my sister, reading: stand aside."
Why should this a desert be?
For it is unpeopled? No:
"Tongues I'll hang on every tree,"
That shall civil sayings show:
"Some, how brief the life of man"
"Runs his erring pilgrimage,"
That the stretching of a span
Buckles in his sum of age;
"Some, of violated vows"
'Twixt the souls of friend and friend:
"But upon the fairest boughs,"
"Or at every sentence end,"
"Will I Rosalinda write,"
Teaching all that read to know
The quintessence of every sprite
Heaven would in little show.
Therefore Heaven Nature charged
That one body should be fill'd
With all graces wide-enlarged:
Nature presently distill'd
"Helen's cheek, but not her heart,"
"Cleopatra's majesty,"
"Atalanta's better part,"
Sad Lucretia's modesty.
Thus Rosalind of many parts
"By heavenly synod was devised,"
"Of many faces, eyes and hearts,"
To have the touches dearest prized.
"Heaven would that she these gifts should have,"
And I to live and die her slave.
O most gentle pulpiter! what tedious homily of love
"have you wearied your parishioners withal, and never"
"cried 'Have patience, good people!'"
"How now! back, friends! Shepherd, go off a little."
"Go with him, sirrah."
"Come, shepherd, let us make an honourable retreat;"
"though not with bag and baggage, yet with scrip and scrippage."
Didst thou hear these verses?
"O, yes, I heard them all, and more too; for some of"
them had in them more feet than the verses would bear.
That's no matter: the feet might bear the verses.
"Ay, but the feet were lame and could not bear"
themselves without the verse and therefore stood
lamely in the verse.
But didst thou hear without wondering how thy name
should be hanged and carved upon these trees?
I was seven of the nine days out of the wonder
before you came; for look here what I found on a
palm-tree. I was never so be-rhymed since
"Pythagoras' time, that I was an Irish rat, which I"
can hardly remember.
Trow you who hath done this?
Is it a man?
"And a chain, that you once wore, about his neck."
Change you colour?
"I prithee, who?"
"O Lord, Lord! it is a hard matter for friends to"
meet; but mountains may be removed with earthquakes
and so encounter.
"Nay, but who is it?"
Is it possible?
"Nay, I prithee now with most petitionary vehemence,"
tell me who it is.
"O wonderful, wonderful, and most wonderful"
"wonderful! and yet again wonderful, and after that,"
out of all hooping!
"Good my complexion! dost thou think, though I am"
"caparisoned like a man, I have a doublet and hose in"
my disposition? One inch of delay more is a
"South-sea of discovery; I prithee, tell me who is it"
"quickly, and speak apace. I would thou couldst"
"stammer, that thou mightst pour this concealed man"
"out of thy mouth, as wine comes out of a narrow-"
"mouthed bottle, either too much at once, or none at"
"all. I prithee, take the cork out of thy mouth that"
may drink thy tidings.
So you may put a man in your belly.
Is he of God's making? What manner of man? Is his
"head worth a hat, or his chin worth a beard?"
"Nay, he hath but a little beard."
"Why, God will send more, if the man will be"
"thankful: let me stay the growth of his beard, if"
thou delay me not the knowledge of his chin.
"It is young Orlando, that tripped up the wrestler's"
heels and your heart both in an instant.
"Nay, but the devil take mocking: speak, sad brow and"
true maid.
"I' faith, coz, 'tis he."
Orlando?
Orlando.
Alas the day! what shall I do with my doublet and
hose? What did he when thou sawest him? What said
he? How looked he? Wherein went he? What makes
him here? Did he ask for me? Where remains he?
How parted he with thee? and when shalt thou see
him again? Answer me in one word.
You must borrow me Gargantua's mouth first: 'tis a
word too great for any mouth of this age's size. To
say ay and no to these particulars is more than to
answer in a catechism.
But doth he know that I am in this forest and in
man's apparel? Looks he as freshly as he did the
day he wrestled?
It is as easy to count atomies as to resolve the
propositions of a lover; but take a taste of my
"finding him, and relish it with good observance."
"I found him under a tree, like a dropped acorn."
"It may well be called Jove's tree, when it drops"
forth such fruit.
"Give me audience, good madam."
Proceed.
"There lay he, stretched along, like a wounded knight."
"Though it be pity to see such a sight, it well"
becomes the ground.
"Cry 'holla' to thy tongue, I prithee; it curvets"
unseasonably. He was furnished like a hunter.
"O, ominous! he comes to kill my heart."
I would sing my song without a burden: thou bringest
me out of tune.
"Do you not know I am a woman? when I think, I must"
"speak. Sweet, say on."
You bring me out. Soft! comes he not here?
"'Tis he: slink by, and note him."
"I thank you for your company; but, good faith, I had"
as lief have been myself alone.
"And so had I; but yet, for fashion sake, I thank you"
too for your society.
God be wi' you: let's meet as little as we can.
I do desire we may be better strangers.
"I pray you, mar no more trees with writing"
love-songs in their barks.
"I pray you, mar no more of my verses with reading"
them ill-favouredly.
Rosalind is your love's name?
"Yes, just."
I do not like her name.
There was no thought of pleasing you when she was
christened.
What stature is she of?
Just as high as my heart.
You are full of pretty answers. Have you not been
"acquainted with goldsmiths' wives, and conned them"
out of rings?
"Not so; but I answer you right painted cloth, from"
whence you have studied your questions.
You have a nimble wit: I think 'twas made of
Atalanta's heels. Will you sit down with me? and
we two will rail against our mistress the world and
all our misery.
"I will chide no breather in the world but myself,"
against whom I know most faults.
The worst fault you have is to be in love.
'Tis a fault I will not change for your best virtue.
I am weary of you.
"By my troth, I was seeking for a fool when I found"
you.
"He is drowned in the brook: look but in, and you"
shall see him.
There I shall see mine own figure.
Which I take to be either a fool or a cipher.
"I'll tarry no longer with you: farewell, good"
Signior Love.
"I am glad of your departure: adieu, good Monsieur"
Melancholy.
"I will speak to him, like a saucy"
lackey and under that habit play the knave with him.
"Do you hear, forester?"
Very well: what would you?
"I pray you, what is't o'clock?"
You should ask me what time o' day: there's no clock
in the forest.
Then there is no true lover in the forest; else
sighing every minute and groaning every hour would
detect the lazy foot of Time as well as a clock.
And why not the swift foot of Time? had not that
been as proper?
"By no means, sir: Time travels in divers paces with"
divers persons. I'll tell you who Time ambles
"withal, who Time trots withal, who Time gallops"
withal and who he stands still withal.
"I prithee, who doth he trot withal?"
"Marry, he trots hard with a young maid between the"
contract of her marriage and the day it is
"solemnized: if the interim be but a se'nnight,"
Time's pace is so hard that it seems the length of
seven year.
Who ambles Time withal?
With a priest that lacks Latin and a rich man that
"hath not the gout, for the one sleeps easily because"
"he cannot study, and the other lives merrily because"
"he feels no pain, the one lacking the burden of lean"
"and wasteful learning, the other knowing no burden"
of heavy tedious penury; these Time ambles withal.
Who doth he gallop withal?
"With a thief to the gallows, for though he go as"
"softly as foot can fall, he thinks himself too soon there."
Who stays it still withal?
"With lawyers in the vacation, for they sleep between"
term and term and then they perceive not how Time moves.
"Where dwell you, pretty youth?"
"With this shepherdess, my sister; here in the"
"skirts of the forest, like fringe upon a petticoat."
Are you native of this place?
As the cony that you see dwell where she is kindled.
Your accent is something finer than you could
purchase in so removed a dwelling.
I have been told so of many: but indeed an old
"religious uncle of mine taught me to speak, who was"
in his youth an inland man; one that knew courtship
"too well, for there he fell in love. I have heard"
"him read many lectures against it, and I thank God"
"I am not a woman, to be touched with so many"
giddy offences as he hath generally taxed their
whole sex withal.
Can you remember any of the principal evils that he
laid to the charge of women?
There were none principal; they were all like one
"another as half-pence are, every one fault seeming"
monstrous till his fellow fault came to match it.
"I prithee, recount some of them."
"No, I will not cast away my physic but on those that"
"are sick. There is a man haunts the forest, that"
abuses our young plants with carving 'Rosalind' on
their barks; hangs odes upon hawthorns and elegies
"on brambles, all, forsooth, deifying the name of"
Rosalind: if I could meet that fancy-monger I would
"give him some good counsel, for he seems to have the"
quotidian of love upon him.
I am he that is so love-shaked: I pray you tell me
your remedy.
There is none of my uncle's marks upon you: he
taught me how to know a man in love; in which cage
of rushes I am sure you are not prisoner.
What were his marks?
"A lean cheek, which you have not, a blue eye and"
"sunken, which you have not, an unquestionable"
"spirit, which you have not, a beard neglected,"
"which you have not; but I pardon you for that, for"
simply your having in beard is a younger brother's
"revenue: then your hose should be ungartered, your"
"bonnet unbanded, your sleeve unbuttoned, your shoe"
untied and every thing about you demonstrating a
careless desolation; but you are no such man; you
are rather point-device in your accoutrements as
loving yourself than seeming the lover of any other.
"Fair youth, I would I could make thee believe I love."
Me believe it! you may as soon make her that you
"love believe it; which, I warrant, she is apter to"
do than to confess she does: that is one of the
points in the which women still give the lie to
"their consciences. But, in good sooth, are you he"
"that hangs the verses on the trees, wherein Rosalind"
is so admired?
"I swear to thee, youth, by the white hand of"
"Rosalind, I am that he, that unfortunate he."
But are you so much in love as your rhymes speak?
Neither rhyme nor reason can express how much.
"Love is merely a madness, and, I tell you, deserves"
as well a dark house and a whip as madmen do: and
the reason why they are not so punished and cured
"is, that the lunacy is so ordinary that the whippers"
are in love too. Yet I profess curing it by counsel.
Did you ever cure any so?
"Yes, one, and in this manner. He was to imagine me"
"his love, his mistress; and I set him every day to"
"woo me: at which time would I, being but a moonish"
"youth, grieve, be effeminate, changeable, longing"
"and liking, proud, fantastical, apish, shallow,"
"inconstant, full of tears, full of smiles, for every"
passion something and for no passion truly any
"thing, as boys and women are for the most part"
"cattle of this colour; would now like him, now loathe"
"him; then entertain him, then forswear him; now weep"
"for him, then spit at him; that I drave my suitor"
from his mad humour of love to a living humour of
"madness; which was, to forswear the full stream of"
"the world, and to live in a nook merely monastic."
And thus I cured him; and this way will I take upon
me to wash your liver as clean as a sound sheep's
"heart, that there shall not be one spot of love in't."
"I would not be cured, youth."
"I would cure you, if you would but call me Rosalind"
and come every day to my cote and woo me.
"Now, by the faith of my love, I will: tell me"
where it is.
Go with me to it and I'll show it you and by the way
you shall tell me where in the forest you live.
Will you go?
"With all my heart, good youth."
"Nay you must call me Rosalind. Come, sister, will you go?"
